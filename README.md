# CoinTraker

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying
a movie with friends and family. In this project, we’ll design and implement an android application
to allow us to find the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [coinpaprika.com](https://api.coinpaprika.com/).

Coinpaprika API delivers free & frequently updated market data from the world of crypto: coin prices, 
volumes, market caps, ATHs, return rates and more.

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with Coinpaprika API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
